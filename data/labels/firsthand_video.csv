Idle,
Reverse,"00:00 There's no pedestrian in the frame. 00:01 A person comes in from the right, with their back and side towards me, looking ahead of me. They turn their side and face towards me, standing in front of me to the right side. They stop in front of me, slightly to the right, head and torso facing me. 00:02, They look down in front of them and me, while taking both their flat hands with spread fingers up to their chest. They look up, and move their hands back and forth towards me at their chest, indicating me to reverse. The arms move quite fast, indicating a hurry. They look serious in their face expression. 00:03 They continue moving their hands back and forth tilted a bit towards each other, while moving closer to me, and more center in front of me. 00:04, they continue their arm movements, while tilting their hands more to each other, and bending their elbows outwards a bit. They move closer and out to the right side. 00:05, they look down, and quickly tilt their hands from side to side, indicating a *no* gesture. They put their hands down and walk out of the frame to the right side close to me."
